macOS: .venv/bin/python3 in place of .venv\\Scripts\\python. Leave the app alone while it runs
(or open the panel / full view first to measure those). It reports, for the app's process:
- memory: working set (what Task Manager shows) and private memory (only this app's);
- CPU: the share of one core used over the whole stretch, and the CPU time behind it;
- threads.
Numbers depend on the machine; measure a few times and quote the typical one.

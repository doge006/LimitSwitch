"""Give memory the app no longer uses back to the system once it settles.

After drawing (a panel, the menu, the full view) and at startup, the process holds pages it won't
touch again until something is drawn next. Trimming the working set hands them back; if they are
needed again, Windows brings them back from RAM (not disk), in microseconds. Private (committed)
memory is unchanged. On macOS, freed large blocks (a closed full view's frames) stay counted
against the app until malloc is asked to release them: malloc_zone_pressure_relief does that. Once, a few seconds after things settle; never while something is moving.
